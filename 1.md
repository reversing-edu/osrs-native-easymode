# Finding component clientcode and the renderEntities function

InterfaceComponents have an attribute called `clientcode` or `contentType` which the game uses to distinguish between types. For example 1338 is the minimap, and 1337 is the viewport. So using this information we are going to find the function responsible for rendering the viewport, and work forwards from there to find how entities are rendered (and thus find entities)


Searching for 1337 only pulled up a few results, so that's great.

The codeblock we are looking for resembles something like this

```
if (component.clientcode == 1337) {
    ...
    renderEntities(x, y, width, height);
    ...
}
```

Since it involves a comparison we know it's one of the three results that show `CMP` in their preview column. Looking through the 3 of them, this one resembled what we wanted the most.

The function at the bottom (FUN_140071230) is `renderEntities`


# Finding entities rendered on the SceneGraph

In the `renderEntities` function you should find some code resembling this https://pastebin.com/DVVu1Azy

To save you time, here is what those functions actually are

For the sake of explanation and learning let's break down each function and how you can find out what they are

## Destination

Based on the previous guide, we already know `0xca38` references the local player, offset 0x10 is absoluteX coordinate and offset 0x14 is absoluteY coordinate. Now it's a matter of figuring out what value the coordinates are being compared to. From runtime debugging you'll notice that they're your destination coordinates. So now you can add client->destinationX and client->destinationY to your collection :)
