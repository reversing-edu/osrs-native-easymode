Since there are a lot of people new to osrs native that don't bother looking at refactors or reverse engineering much themselves I figured I'd make a semi leechable guide on how you can find most things that a bot would need.

Note that these identification methods rely on engine fundamentals which have not changed since osrs release (and some even as far back as 317 and earlier) so expect them to be reliable for the most part.

**Requirements:**
- Half a brain. If missing, I recommend contacting Oak to purchase - preferably a full one
- Basic knowledge to operate a reverse engineering suite (Ghidra, IDA etc)


**Steps**
